# PRD Questions

Please answer these questions to help create a meaningful PRD based on your actual requirements.

## Current State & Pain Points

### 1. Newsletter volume
How many newsletters do you currently receive per day/week? Which ones do you find most valuable?

**Answer:**

### 2. Current workflow
How do you handle newsletters today? Do you read them in Gmail, mark as read, archive, delete? What's frustrating about this?

**Answer:**

### 3. Signal loss
Can you give me 2-3 concrete examples of signals you've missed or found too late because they were buried in noise?

**Answer:**

### 4. Context switching
When you mentioned 2-minute breaks vs commutes—what device(s) are you on in each scenario? What exactly would you want to see differently?

**Answer:**

## Email Classification

### 5. Human vs automated
How do you want to distinguish these? Is "from a person I know" sufficient, or are there automated emails from individuals you want processed?

**Answer:**

### 6. Newsletter post-processing
After extracting signals from a newsletter, what should happen to it in Gmail? Archive? Keep unread? Mark with a label?

**Answer:**

### 7. Transactional emails
Give me examples of transactional emails you receive. Which ones need action vs which are just FYI? Should bills/shipping notifications become tasks?

**Answer:**

### 8. Edge cases
What about group emails, automated reports from work, GitHub notifications, etc.?

**Answer:**

## Signal Aggregation

### 9. "Same event" definition
If 3 newsletters cover the same AI model release, what makes you confident they're covering the *same* thing vs different aspects?

**Answer:**

### 10. Aggregated view
When you see an aggregated entry, what information do you need? (e.g., "5 sources", source names, combined summary, links to each original?)

**Answer:**

### 11. Drill-down
When you want to read more, should you see the full newsletter in-app or open Gmail?

**Answer:**

## Urgency & Priority

### 12. Urgency examples
Can you give me 2-3 examples each of what would be:
- **Immediate** (push notification):
- **Hours** (needs attention today):
- **Days/weeks** (can wait):
- **FYI only** (informational):

**Answer:**

### 13. Urgency determination
Should this be rule-based (keywords, sender, patterns) or learned from your behaviour?

**Answer:**

## Feed Experience

### 14. First-time feed open
When you open the app, what's the default view? Most urgent? Most recent? Algorithmically ranked?

**Answer:**

### 15. Actions on items
What should you be able to do with a feed item? (Dismiss, save for later, mark as read, create task, something else?)

**Answer:**

### 16. Read status
Should items disappear after you read them, or stay visible with changed styling?

**Answer:**

## Progressive Delivery

### 17. Absolute minimum
If you could only build *one* feature to start, what would reduce your pain the most? (e.g., just classifying and archiving newsletters, no aggregation yet?)

**Answer:**

### 18. What can wait
From the existing IDEA.md features, what genuinely doesn't matter for months? What's nice-to-have vs need-to-have?

**Answer:**

### 19. Early testing
At what point would this be useful enough for you to actually use daily?

**Answer:**

## Future Sources (for context, not immediate)

### 20. Social media priority
Which platforms matter most to you? Twitter/Reddit/HackerNews/YouTube/others?

**Answer:**

### 21. Social signals
What does a "signal" look like on social media vs newsletters? Viral threads? Specific accounts? Topic trends?

**Answer:**
